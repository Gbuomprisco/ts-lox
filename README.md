# ts-lox

A Typescript implementation for the Lox programming language, described by Bob Nystrom in his awesome book [Crafting Interpreters](http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/). The syntax is slightly changed based on my personal preferences.

The implementation is not yet complete, as it still lacks functions, for loops and classes.

This repository used the [typescript-starter](https://github.com/bitjson/typescript-starter) library.
