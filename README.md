# ts-lox

A Typescript implementation for the Lox programming language, described by Bob Nystrom in his awesome book [Crafting Interpreters](http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/). The syntax is slightly changed based on my personal preferences.

The implementation is not yet complete, as it still lacks functions and classes.

## Using the interpreter

Run the file index.ts using `ts-node` and provide a parameter for the file to be parsed. From the directory `src`:

    ts-node index.ts <my-lox-file>
